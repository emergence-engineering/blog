# What's this about?

Release of [Discord gitBot](https://discordgitbot.com/): get notified about GitHub events.

We're aiming at becoming a more product-focused company, and this small(ish) app is just the first in many more to come 
( hopefully! ).

I'd love to hear your feedback, feel free to [drop a mail](mailto:viktor.vaczi@emergence-engineering.com).
